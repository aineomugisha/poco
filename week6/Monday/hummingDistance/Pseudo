Compare two strands of DNA 

//Input 
Initialize stringOne 
Initialize stringTwo
Initialize count 


//Output 
THe hamming distance counting differences between two strings (number of differences)


//Process
If first index in stringOne = first index in stringTwo count = 0
count++
//contraints 
- should be equal length 
- comparing with different length should not work

stringOne.length === StringTwo.lenght
