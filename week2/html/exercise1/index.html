    <h2>HTML Anchors</h2>
An anchor is a piece of text which marks the beginning and/or the end of a hypertext link.
The text between the opening tag and the closing tag is either the start or destination (or both) of a link. Attributes of the anchor tag are as follows. <strong>I used the a anchor to point to different sections of this page <a href="">above</a></strong>


<br>
    <h2>HTML lists</h2>
HTML lists are used to present list of information in well formed and semantic way. There are three different types of list in HTML and each one has a specific purpose and meaning.
<ul><li>This is an example of unordered list— The are used to create a list of related items, in no particular order.</li> </ul> 
<ol><li>This is an example of an Ordered list — They are used to create a list of related items, in a specific order. For example when describing a recipe.</li> </ol> 
<dl><dt>This is an example of a description list — <dd>They are used to create a list of terms and their descriptions.</dd></dl> 


<br>
    <h2>HTML Semantics</h2>
    Semantic HTML5 defines specific tags to indicate clearly what role is played by the content those tags contain. That explicit information helps robots/crawlers like Google and Bing to better understand which content is important, which is a subsidiary, which is for navigation, and so on.
    <br><strong>
By adding semantic HTML tags to your pages, you provide additional information that helps Google and Bing understand the roles and relative importance of the different parts of your page. <a href=""><em>more on html semantic tags</em></a></strong>

        <h2>HTML Images</h2>
    This is an image of the boilerplate I created for this assignment. <img src="boilerplate.png" alt="image of boilerplate"> <br><strong>A boilerplates are sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration. </strong>
