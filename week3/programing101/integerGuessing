Input

 x is the guessed number 
 y = max/2
 
 midpoint - z
    z=max/2

Display: Is your number less than or greater than or equal to z? Please klick on one of these options
less, = and greater buttons     

    Is x = z?
    If yes print Hurray

    
 Step less than
    if x is less than z 
        newMax=z
        y=newMax/2;
         Display: Is your number greater than or less than or equal to y?
     If x=y print yaay
     If more 
        z=y;
        newMax=z
        go back to step1

Step greater than
     if x is greater than z
     max=100;
        y=(max-z)/2;
        Display: Is your number greater than or less than or equal to y?
        If less
            z=y; go to step less
